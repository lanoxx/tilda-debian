    * There is a new unlimited scrollback option.
    * Some improvements for different window managers were made.
    * Tilda can no be focuses with the hotkey instead of hiding it
      when it is currently not focused. This new behavior is configurable.
    * A locking issue has been fixed if multiple tilda instances were started
      at the same time, which caused a race condition to appear and could
      delete the configuration file.
    * There is a new option to hide the tab bar and the border when multiple
      tabs are open.
    * When a new tab is opened the tab will now inherit its working directory
      from the old tab. This behavior is active by default and can only be
      disabled from an option in the config file.
